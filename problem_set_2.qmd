## Question 1

*Points: 5*

Using the `states` data, produce a scatterplot of the variables `womleg_2015` and `libpct_m` (with `womleg_2015` as the dependent variable on the y-axis). Describe the scatterplot and include a copy of it. Note any suspected outliers, if any (a visual inspection will suffice for this question). Lastly, give the general equation for the correlation between `womleg_2015` and `libpct_m` (include as much information as possible), but do not solve it.

::: callout-note
The `states` data set can be found in `poliscidata::states`. Take a look at `?states` to see what these variables measure.

#Disable warnings globally
options(warn=-1)
#.rs.restartR()

#Package loading
requiredPackages <- c("poliscidata",
                      "ggplot2",
                      "magrittr",
                      "dplyr",
                      "data.table", 
                      "broom",
                      "rstatix",
                      "modelsummary")

#Installs packages if not yet installed
for (package in requiredPackages) 
{ 
  if (!requireNamespace(package, quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages(package)
  
}

invisible(lapply(requiredPackages, require, character.only = TRUE, quietly = T))
rm(list=ls())
```

```{r}
data <- poliscidata::states

# Scatter plot of the data
ggplot(data = data, aes(x=libpct_m, y=womleg_2015)) +
  geom_point(size=3, shape=25) 
```

Adding trend lines to determine the strength and the direction of the relationship:

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x=libpct_m, y=womleg_2015)) +
  geom_point(size=2, shape=23) + geom_smooth(method=loess, se=FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE)
```

Based on the scatter plot, I have added two trend lines , one linear and the other non-linear to see the variable relationships. Based on the upward movement of lines, we can see that the two variables are positively linked.

Based on a visual of the plot, we can see two points that can be considered outliers that are at the very top of the graph

General equation of correlation:

``` latex
$$
\frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y}) }{%
      \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}}
$$
```

Pearson correlation is used in order to determine the strength of association between two continuous variables.

```{r}
#Correlation of variables: 
cor(data$libpct_m, data$womleg_2015)
```

A correlation of 0.6 is fairly strong. I would assume from the plots and the pearson correlation that these two variables are positively correlated.

## Question 2

*Points: 5*

Regress `womleg_2015` (as the dependent variable) on `libpct_m` and report the results in a professionally formatted table. Write the model equation with the estimated coefficients and interpret them. What does the value of $R^2$ tell us about this model?

```{r}
lm_obj <- lm(womleg_2015 ~ libpct_m, data = data)
modelsummary::modelsummary(lm_obj)
```

Model equation: womleg_2015 = libpct_m \* 1.145986 + 1.523990

Interpretation:

The intercept term, in this case 1.523 is the value the model returns when all the variables are zero. This means that if the state has zero liberals, there would be 1.5% of the state legislators being women.

The coefficient for the percentage term is 1.45. This means that on average an increase of percentage of liberals is almost directly related to the percentage of women legislators in 2015.

Although we should note that regression results that are based on percentages should not be directly interpreted in this manner.

R2 value is : 0.371. This means that only about a little more than a third of the variance of the Y variable can be adequately explained by the libpct_m variable.

This would generally not be considered a good model

## Question 3

*Points: 5*

Based on this regression, find the predicted value, the observed value, and compute the residual for the state of Colorado and then the state of Georgia. Lastly, compute the total aggregate error from those two select observations combined (i.e., Colorado and Georgia).

```{r}
#Colarado
#Shift to data table
data <- as.data.table(data)

data_col <- data[stateid == as.character(unique(data$stateid)[6]),] #Extracting the data
Predicted_col <- predict(lm_obj, data = data_col$libpct_m)[6] #Predicting using lm model
Residual_col = data_col$womleg_2015 - Predicted_col #Residual calculations
```

```{r}
#The observed value for Colorado is:
data_col$womleg_2015
```

```{r}
#The predicted value is for colarado is:
Predicted_col
```

```{r}
#The Residual for colarado is:
Residual_col
```

```{r}
#Georgia
data_gerog <- data[stateid == as.character(unique(data$stateid)[10]),] #Extracting the data
Predicted_gerog <- predict(lm_obj, data = data_col$libpct_m)[10] #Predicting using lm model
Residual_georg = data_gerog$womleg_2015 - Predicted_gerog #Residual calculations
```

```{r}
#The observed value for Georgia is:
data_gerog$womleg_2015
```

```{r}
#The predicted value is for Georgia is:
Predicted_gerog
```

```{r}
#The Residual for Georgia is:
Residual_georg
```

```{r}
#The total RSS aggregate error is:
sum(Residual_georg^2, Residual_col^2)
```

## Question 4

*Points: 5*

Using the `states` dataset, assess the relationship between the following two variables: `obama_win12` and `gun_rank3`. Construct a cross-tab and describe the nature of the relationship (if any) in detail.

::: callout-note
The variable `Obama_win12` is a dichotomous indicator of whether Obama won the state in 2012 (Obama won; Obama lost). The variable `gun_rank3` represents the general (ordinal) extent of gun restrictions in each state (more restrictions; middle restrictions; less restrictions).
:::

::: callout-caution
Please note that you would customarily want a greater number of observations within each cell before conducting such an analysis.
:::

Ans:

```{r}
#Cross table
datasummary_crosstab(obama_win12 ~ gun_rank3, data = data)
```

We do note that the number of observations are not enough to generate any meaningful understanding. However, with just basing our analysis on the crosstable, we can see that on average Obama won in states that had far greater gun control restrictions. 54% of all states that had high control laws elected Obama. The contrast is even great for less restrictive where 75% of all states with less restrictive laws did not elect him. This suggests are strong relationship between the two variables.

## Question 5

*Points: 5*

I hypothesize that religious identifiers in the mass public are less likely to support federal government support of scientific research. I use data from the General Social Survey to evaluate this hypothesis. In particular, I use a three-category indicator of religious attendance to measure religious identification (low attendance; moderate attendance; high attendance) and a three-category indicator of perceptions toward the federal government's support for scientific research (federal government provides "too little" support; "about right"; federal government provides "too much" support). Complete the cross-tab below so that you may properly evaluate my hypothesis.

::: callout-note
Table entries are raw counts of observations within each cell.
:::

![](img/ps2_cross_tab.png)

Formatted cross table:

```{r}
#Recreating the data
Cross_tab_data <- as.data.frame(matrix(data = NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 3))
names(Cross_tab_data) <- c('Too Little', 'About Right', 'Too Much')
rownames(Cross_tab_data) <- c('Low', 'Moderate', 'High')

Cross_tab_data[1,1] <- 342
Cross_tab_data[1,2] <- 356
Cross_tab_data[1,3] <- 106
Cross_tab_data[2,1] <- 190
Cross_tab_data[2,2] <- 213
Cross_tab_data[2,3] <- 51
Cross_tab_data[3,1] <- 182
Cross_tab_data[3,2] <- 287
Cross_tab_data[3,3] <- 91

#Creating the cross tab and summarizing results 
Cross_tab_dataframe <- rstatix::counts_to_cases(Cross_tab_data)
names(Cross_tab_dataframe) <- c('Religon', 'Science') 

datasummary_crosstab(Religon ~ Science, data = Cross_tab_dataframe)
```

Based on the crosstab analysis there does not seem to be a very high correlation between belief in religion and support of science funding. The percentage spread for Low, Moderate and High is roughly the same in relation to science funding. High religion has a slight increase in thinking that there is too much support, but it is comparable to the other categories.

## Question 6

*Points: 5*

Say I wish to explore the relationship between the relative advantage of Democrats (`dem_advantage`) in a state and abortion policy (`abort_rank3`). The `dem_advantage` variable is a continuous indicator where higher values represent a greater Democratic advantage among the mass public; `abort_rank3` is an ordinal indicator for the extent of abortion restrictions in each state (fewer restrictions; middle restrictions; more restrictions). To explore this relationship, complete the following:

### Part A

Create a new variable (i.e., `dem_adv`) based on the `dem_advantage` variable. Calculate the summary statistics of `dem_advantage` and assign the following values to our new variable: if `dem_advantage` is less than the first quartile, set `dem_adv` to `Low`; if the value for `dem_advantage` is greater than the first quartile and less than the third quartile, set the value to `Mid`; and if the value of `dem_advantage` is greater than the third quartile, set the value to `High`.

```{r}
data[, dem_adv := 'NA']
Quart_1 <- as.numeric(summary(data$dem_advantage))[2]
Quart_3 <- as.numeric(summary(data$dem_advantage))[5]

data <- as.data.table(data)[dem_advantage < Quart_1 , dem_adv := 'low'][]
data <- as.data.table(data)[dem_advantage > Quart_1 & dem_advantage < Quart_3 , dem_adv := 'medium'][]
data <- as.data.table(data)[dem_advantage > Quart_3 , dem_adv := 'high'][]
```

### Part B

Create a crosstab using R; include your results in a professionally formatted table.

```{r}
datasummary_crosstab(dem_adv ~ abort_rank3, data = data)
```

### Part C

What relationship (if any) is there between the relative advantage of Democrats is a given state and the restrictiveness of Abortion policy?

Based on the crosstab data, there seems to be more advantage the less restrictive abortion is in the state. Where the dem advantage is high, zero states have heavily regulated abortion. The opposite is also true strengthening the argument, dems have low and medium advantages in states where the restrictions are high nearly 45% of states in the more restrictive category have less dem advantage.
